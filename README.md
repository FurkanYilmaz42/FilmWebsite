## üìå About the Project  
**FilmWebsitesi** is a dynamic website where users can explore a variety of films. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this project allows users to interact with movie posters, view detailed information, and switch between day and night modes.  
Upon entering the website, you are greeted with a **movie poster** and a **play button**. At the top, there are **navigation buttons** that turn red when hovered over. In the top-right corner, there is a dynamic **day-night mode button** to switch between themes. On the left, a **sidebar** contains icons for easy navigation.  
As you scroll down, you can select movie **categories** from a **selector** and view movie posters. The posters can be dynamically navigated using arrow buttons, allowing users to scroll through the posters, with the last poster returning to the first when clicked.  
When hovering over any movie poster, it slightly enlarges and displays the movie's name along with **Play**, **Like**, **Dislike**, and **Add to Favorites** options.  
This project is also **responsive**, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices, including mobile phones, tablets, and desktop screens.
